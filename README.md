# Gold Stock Prices - Predictive Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project that uses the Facebook Prophet library to perform a machine learning-based predictive analysis.

## Dataset
This data set provides a comprehensive record of daily gold prices from January 19, 2014 to January 22, 2024. The data is provided by Nasdaq and includes key financial metrics for each trading day. More informations about this dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahilwagh/gold-stock-prices

## Features
The dataset consists of the following columns: 

- Date: A unique date for each trading day recorded.
- Close: The closing price of gold on the relevant date.
- Volume: Gold trading volume on the relevant date.
- Open: The opening price of gold on the relevant date.
- High: The highest recorded price of gold during the trading day.
- Low: The lowest price recorded for gold in the trading day.

## Methodology
The Facebook Prophet library was used for this predictive analysis. The process involves data exploration, data visualization, model training, and e prediction.

## Results
The price of gold exhibits a growing trend, seasonal fluctuations and high volatility over time. These features are captured by the Facebook Prophet model, which generates predictions with a mean absolute error of 13.64 dollars per troy ounce. According to the model, the price of gold will keep increasing in the next quarter. To obtain predictions for longer periods, the model should be adjusted to fit the desired time interval.
